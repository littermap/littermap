### So you would like to contribute to the Litter Map software platform?

Wonderful! No previous qualifications are required. However, the following guidelines are important:

- We want this to be a robust, extensible platform that will endure the test of heavy usage
- We want to be conscious about performance
- We want to have a nice community of people who respect each other
- Despite its sophistication, we want the project to be approachable to contributors
- We'd like to build this platform in a way that outsiders can understand how it works

Also, we invite you to use anything from this project in your open source project. The code, contributed by the contributors, is published under the [AGPL-3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0) or later license.

If you'd like to simply report a bug, please check to see if an [issue](https://github.com/littermap/littermap/issues) already exists, and if not create one.

If you have a question or would like to start a new topic, check the [discussion](https://github.com/littermap/littermap/discussions) board.

Code contributions are not the only way to help. Answering questions, helping others, reaching out and improving the documentation are immensely valuable to the community.

## The project's direction of development

Our goal is to create the best global website for people to share information about littered locations and to create a place through which everyone worldwide can effectively collaborate on cleaning up our planet without the necessity of even knowing each other.

First and foremost, we want to promote a collaborative and respectful community. Therefore, we ask that all community members be kind and considerate regardless of circumstances.
